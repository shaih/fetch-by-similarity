## Running the fetch-by-similarity workload

```console
git clone <<reposiroty-URL>> <<path>>
cd <<path>>>
python3 harness/run_submission.py -h # Provide information about command-line options
```
The first time you run `harness/run_submission.py`, it will attempt to pull and build openfhe if it is not already installed, and will then build the submission itself. On subsequent calls it will use the same project without re-buildin git unless the code has changed. An example run is provided below.

```console
$ python3 harness/run_submission.py -h
usage: run_submission.py [-h] [--num_runs NUM_RUNS] [--seed SEED] {0,1,2,3}

Run the fetch-by-similarity FHE benchmark.

positional arguments:
  {0,1,2,3}            Instance size (0-toy/1-small/2-medium/3-large)

options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --num_runs NUM_RUNS  Number of times to run steps 4-9 (default: 1)
  --seed SEED          Random seed for dataset and query generation
$
$ python ./harness/run_submission.py 0 --seed 12345 --num_runs 2
